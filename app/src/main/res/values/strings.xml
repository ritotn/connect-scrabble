    <string name="instr_body">To play, players take turns placing a letter from the tile rack.
        Each tile must be placed adjacent to a tile which has already been placed. As tiles are
        placed, new letters are added from the tilebag based on their frequency. To win the game,
        a player must create a 4-letter word which exists in the dictionary, which is sourced from
        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/getify/dwordly-game/main/four-letter-words.json. \n \nClick on an empty cell to place a tile,
        click on it again to remove the tile, and click "Play Turn" to submit a turn. Have fun!!!
