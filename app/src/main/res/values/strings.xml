    <string name="instr_body">To play, players take turns placing a letter from the tile rack.
        Each tile must be placed adjacent to a tile which has already been placed. As tiles are
        placed, new letters are added from the tilebag based on their frequency. To win the game,
        a player must create a 4-letter word which exists in the dictionary, which is sourced from
        https://www.thefreedictionary.com/4-letter-words.htm. \n \nClick on an empty cell to place a tile, click on it again to remove the tile, and click
        "Play Turn" to submit a turn. Have fun!
