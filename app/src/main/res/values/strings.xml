        Tiles must be placed adjacent to an already placed tile. As they are
        placed, new letters are added to the tile rack based on letter frequency. \n \n To win,
        you must form a valid 4-letter word (dictionary: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/getify/dwordly-game/main/four-letter-words.json). \n \nClick on an empty cell to place a tile,
        click on it again to remove the tile, and click "Play Turn" to submit a turn. Have fun!!!
